                About the league:
                <br>
                The League is a swiss-style five-round tournament (except you can play against the same opponent more than once)
                <br>
                By default, communication happens via Lichess' chat function, with the provided links
                <br>
                The notification email may land in your spam folder, as it is sent by a bot
                <br>
                The player with the WHITE pieces must challenge the player with the BLACK ones
                <br> 
                The matches must have a length of 10+5 (10 minutes plus 5 seconds per move), <br> and it must be rated, otherwise they are invalid and have to be replayed
                <br>
                Contestants must agree upon a mutually accessible date with <br> their opponent on Mondays (when the standings chart is updated, and the raffle happens)
                <br>
                After a game has finished, the winner must send the link of the game to chesscapist@gmail.com
